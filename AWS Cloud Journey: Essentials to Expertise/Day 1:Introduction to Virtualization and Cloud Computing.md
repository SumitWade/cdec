# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## What is Cloud Computing?

### Definition
- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud")
- Services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model instead of buying and maintaining physical infrastructure

### Key Characteristics
1. **On-demand Self-service**
   - Users can provision resources automatically
   - No human interaction needed with service providers

2. **Broad Network Access**
   - Services available over the network
   - Access through standard mechanisms
   - Support for various client platforms

3. **Resource Pooling**
   - Provider's computing resources pooled to serve multiple consumers
   - Multi-tenant model
   - Dynamic resource assignment and reassignment

4. **Rapid Elasticity**
   - Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released
   - Scale up or down automatically
   - Appears unlimited to the consumer

5. **Measured Service**
   - Resource usage monitored, controlled, and reported
   - Pay-per-use billing model
   - Transparent resource utilization

## Virtualization

### What is Virtualization?
- Creation of a virtual version of computing resources
- Allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine
- Enables efficient resource utilization and isolation

### Types of Virtualization
1. **Server Virtualization**
   - Multiple virtual servers on one physical server
   - Each virtual server runs its own OS
   - Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V

2. **Storage Virtualization**
   - Pooling of physical storage from multiple devices
   - Appears as a single storage device
   - Improved storage management and utilization

3. **Network Virtualization**
   - Creation of virtual networks
   - Independent of physical network infrastructure
   - Enhanced security and flexibility

4. **Desktop Virtualization**
   - Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)
   - Centralized desktop management
   - Remote access to desktop environments

### Benefits of Virtualization
- Improved resource utilization
- Reduced hardware costs
- Enhanced disaster recovery
- Simplified management
- Increased flexibility and scalability
