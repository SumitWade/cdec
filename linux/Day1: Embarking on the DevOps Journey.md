# Day 1: Introduction to DevOps

## Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

### Key Principles of DevOps
1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
   - Regular code integration
   - Automated testing
   - Early bug detection

2. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**
   - Automated deployment
   - Frequent releases
   - Reliable delivery process

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Version-controlled infrastructure
   - Automated provisioning
   - Consistent environments

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Performance tracking
   - Issue detection

## How IT Company Works

### Traditional IT Structure
1. **Development Team**
   - Write code
   - Create features
   - Fix bugs

2. **Testing Team**
   - Quality assurance
   - Bug reporting
   - Test automation

3. **Operations Team**
   - System maintenance
   - Deployment
   - Infrastructure management

### Modern IT Structure (DevOps)
1. **Cross-functional Teams**
   - Combined expertise
   - Shared responsibilities
   - Faster communication

2. **Automated Processes**
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Automated testing
   - Automated deployment

3. **Continuous Feedback**
   - Regular monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - User feedback

## What is an Application?

An application is a software program designed to perform specific tasks for users.

### Types of Applications
1. **Web Applications**
   - Browser-based
   - Frontend and backend
   - Database integration

2. **Mobile Applications**
   - iOS/Android
   - Native/Hybrid
   - App store distribution

3. **Desktop Applications**
   - Standalone software
   - System integration
   - Local processing

### Application Components
1. **Frontend**
   - User interface
   - Client-side logic
   - User interactions

2. **Backend**
   - Server-side logic
   - Database operations
   - API endpoints

3. **Database**
   - Data storage
   - Data retrieval
   - Data management
